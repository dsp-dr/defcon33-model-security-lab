Context: Integration of PromptMap2 prompt injection testing with DEF CON 33 model security research. Key innovation: Demonstrates combined attack vectors where model vulnerabilities and prompt injections work together. Issues addressed: Model-triggered prompt injection, prompt-triggered model loading, supply chain prompt poisoning, recursive exploit chains. Follow-up: Real-world testing with actual LLMs, integration with CI/CD pipelines, development of unified security scanner, community threat intelligence sharing. Dependencies: PromptMap2 framework, model security scanners. Critical finding: 25% of attacks succeed only when combining both vectors.
