Context: Model poisoning through weight manipulation and backdoor insertion. Issues: Training-time poisoning, post-training weight modification, trigger-based backdoors, supply chain attacks. Key findings: Statistical analysis reveals tampering, FFT detects periodic patterns, outlier analysis finds anomalies. Follow-up: Behavioral testing for triggers, differential testing between versions, real-time monitoring systems.
